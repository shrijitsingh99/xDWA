1. There exists and inverse relationship between number of best trajectories chosen to evaluate and the the resolution of x and theta velocity samples.
If (x, theta) resolution is set to (0.05, 0.05) then 3 best trajectories chosen is sufficient.
If (x, theta) resolution is set to (0.01, 0.01) then 8 best trajectories chosen is sufficient.
This is due to the fact that at higher resolution most paths are similar so we need to analyse a larger of number of paths so that we cang get sufficiently different number of paths.
